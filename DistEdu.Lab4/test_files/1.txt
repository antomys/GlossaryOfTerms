In compliance with therequest which it contains, I send you herewith a copy of the discoursepreached last Sunday in the Ebenezer Chapel, Georgetown, D. C. It isidentically the same in all its parts. I have amplified some of itsthoughts, and added three or four notes, which I think valuable anduseful.That its teachings may be productive of good to those for whom it wasprepared, and bring glory to Him, who is High over all and blessed forever, is the fervent prayer of                         Your humble servant,                                                    DANIEL A. PAYNE._To_ REV. JAMES LYNCH _and others_.                       WELCOME TO THE RANSOMED,                                ――OR,――    Duties of the Colored Inhabitants of the District of Columbia.                            I. TIM. 2, 1–4.                            [Illustration]St. Paul addressed the Epistles to Timothy, the young Bishop ofEphesus, for the purpose of giving him instructions touching the falsedoctrines inculcated by certain false teachers, as well as instructionsrespecting the qualifications of the Christian ministry, their dutiesto themselves, to God, and the flock committed by the Holy Spirit totheir special guidance.But foremost of all the duties which he enjoined upon the Ephesianministry and laity were those of making “Supplications, prayers,intercessions, and giving of thanks for all men.” For men in general,embracing the whole family of Adam, in all their _varieties_ asnations, tribes, communities, peoples.This is God-like, because the Eternal loves all, and manifests theinfinity of his nature, by his universal care for all mankind. In this,He also demonstrates His universal Fatherhood, and thereby establishesthe brotherhood of man.But guided by the benevolence of unerring wisdom, the Apostledescends from a general to a particular statement of the case, and_commands_ us to single out from among the nations of the earth theirchieftains――_Kings_ and _authorities_――for whom we are to make special“Supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks.”To the cheerful and fervent performance of this gracious work, hepresses several motives upon us――“that we may live a quiet andpeaceable life in all godliness and honesty”――because “it is good andacceptable in the sight of God our Saviour”――because God “will have allmen to be saved and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.” Let usbriefly trace out this line of thought.To supplicate, is to _implore_ God _submissively_. To pray to God, isto adore Him for His glorious perfection, to confess our sins to Him,and to beseech Him for mercy and pardon. To intercede with God is toentreat Him by the fervent, effectual prayer of faith, to be reconciledto offending man. This we may do as well for our enemies as for ourfriends.We are gathered to celebrate the emancipation, yea, rather, the_Redemption_ of the enslaved people of the District of Columbia, theexact number of whom we have no means of ascertaining, because, sincethe benevolent intention of Congress became manifest, many have beenremoved by their owners beyond the reach of this beneficent act.Our pleasing task then, is to welcome to the Churches, the homesteads,and circles of free colored Americans, those who remain to enjoy _theboon of holy Freedom_.Brethren, sisters, friends, we say welcome to our Churches, welcome toour homesteads, welcome to our social circles.Enter the great family of Holy Freedom; not to _lounge in sinfulindolence_, not to _degrade yourselves by vice_, nor to _corruptsociety by licentiousness_, neither to _offend the laws by crime_,but to the _enjoyment of a well regulated liberty_, the offspring ofgenerous laws; of law as just as generous, as righteous as just――aliberty to be _perpetuated_ by equitable law, and sanctioned bythe divine; for law is never equitable, righteous, just, until itharmonizes with the will of Him, who is “_King_ of kings, and _Lord_of lords,” and who commanded Israel to _have but one law for thehome-born_ and the _stranger_.We repeat ourselves, welcome then _ye ransomed ones_; welcome _not_ toindolence, to vice, licentiousness, and crime, but to a well-regulatedliberty, sanctioned by the Divine, maintained by the Human law.Welcome to habits of industry and thrift――to duties of religion andpiety――to obligations of law, order, government――of government divine,of government human: these two, though not one, are inseparable. Theman who refuses to obey divine law, will never obey human laws. _Thedivine first_, the _human next_. The latter is the consequence of theformer, and follows it as light does the rising sun.We invite you to our Churches, because we desire you to be religious;to be more than religious; we urge you _to be godly_. We entreat you tonever be content until you are emancipated from sin, from sin without,and from sin within you. But this kind of freedom is attained onlythrough the faith of Jesus, love for Jesus, obedience to Jesus. Ascertain as the American Congress has _ransomed_ you, so certain, yea,more certainly has Jesus redeemed you from the guilt and power of sinby his own precious blood.As you are now free in body, so now seek to be free in soul and spirit,from sin and Satan. The _noblest freeman is he whom Christ makes free_.We invite you to our homesteads, in order that we may aid you as wellby the power of good examples as by the beauty of holy precept, inraising up intelligent, virtuous, pious, happy families. We inviteyou to our social circles, in order that you may have none of thoseinducements which grow out of a mere love of society, to frequent the_gambling hells_, and groggeries, which gradually lead their votariesto infamy and the pit that is bottomless.Permit us, also, to advise you to seek every opportunity for thecultivation of your minds. To the adults we say, enter the SundaySchools and the Night Schools, so opportunely opened by Dr. Pierson, inbehalf of the American Tract Society. In these latter you can very soonlearn to read the precious word of God, even before you shall have afamiliar knowledge of the letters which constitute the alphabet._Rest not till you have learned to read the Bible._ ’Tis the greatest,the best of books. In it is contained the Divine law. O! meditatetherein by day and by night, for “the law of the Lord is perfect,converting the soul; the testimony of the Lord is sure, making wisethe simple; the statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart;the commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes;――more tobe desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold; sweeter alsothan honey and the honeycomb.” “_In keeping of them there is greatreward._” Yield uniform, implicit obedience to their teachings. Theywill purify your hearts and make them the abodes of the Ever-BlessedTrinity.When you shall have reached this point, you will be morally preparedto recognize and respond to all the relations of civilized andchristianized life.But of the children take _special care_. Heaven has entrusted them toyou for a _special purpose_. What is that purpose? Not merely to eatand to drink, still less to _gormandize_. Not merely to dress finelyin broadcloths, silks, satins, jewelry, nor to dance to the sound ofthe tambourine and fiddle; but _to learn them how to live and how todie――to train them for great usefulness on earth――to prepare them forgreater glory in heaven_.Keep your children in the schools, even if you have to eat less, drinkless and wear coarser raiments; though you eat but two meals a day,purchase but one change of garment during the year, and relinquish allthe luxuries of which we are so fond, but which are as injurious tohealth and long life as they are pleasing to the taste.Let the education of your children penetrate the heart.――That educationwhich forgets, or purposely omits, the culture of the heart, _is betteradapted to devilism than manhood_. But the education which reaches theheart, moulds it, humbles it before the Cross, is rather the work ofthe homestead than the common school or the college. It is given by the_parents_ rather than the schoolmaster――by the _mother_ rather than thefather.How important, then, that the mothers be _right-minded_; that ouryoung women, of whom our mothers come, be brought up with a highsense of personal character――be taught to prefer virtue to gold, anddeath itself rather than a violated chastity. The women make the men;therefore the women should be greater than the men, in order that theybe the mothers of great men. I mean good men, _for none are great whoare not good_.But this requires the transforming grace of God; requires that ourmothers be women of strong faith and fervent daily prayers; requiresthat they live beneath the wings of the Cherubim――at the foot ofthe Cross――loving the God-man “whose favor is life, and whose lovingkindness is better than life.”Such mothers will care for the heart education of their children,and will consequently lay continuous siege to the Throne of God inbehalf of their sons and daughters, even as the Syrophœnician motherimportuned the compassionate Jesus in behalf of her afflicted daughter,or as Queen Esther did Ahasuerus in behalf of her menaced kinsmen.Such mothers will carefully train their children, as Moses was trainedby his mother, preserving him pure from _the vices of a Court_ and thebaneful examples of lordly superiors: or, like Susanna Wesley, willeducate their sons, as she did John and Charles, in the atmosphere ofsuch spiritual excellence, and with such a moral power, as will makethem ministering angels of good to man and glory to God Most High.Lastly――Let us advise you respecting money. Some people value it toomuch, others too little. Of these extremes take the medium; for moneyhas its proper value. That value _lies in its adaptedness to promotethe ends of Christian enlightenment_; to purchase the best medicalaid and other comforts in the days of affliction; to administer to thewants of old age, and to enable us to assist in making mankind wiserand better.But how are we to get money? Get it by diligent labor. Work, work,work! Shun no work that will bring you an honest penny. ’Tis honorableto labor with our own hands. God works, and shall man be greater thanGod? Fools only think labor dishonorable. Wise men feel themselveshonored in following the example of God, whose works adorn and blessboth heaven and earth.But when you get the pennies save them. Then you will soon havedollars. The dollars will enable you to buy comfortable homes foryourselves and your children.You can save your pennies――yea, dollars――if you will _run away_ fromwhiskey, rum and tobacco. A few years ago an intelligent minister saidthat the colored people of the District of Columbia spent ten thousanddollars a year for tobacco.――What a sum for poison! Better take thatmoney to build churches and school houses; better take it to obtainand pay thoroughly educated teachers for your pulpits and your schoolhouses――_the schoolmasters_ as well as the preachers.Work for money; work every day, work diligently, and _save your moneywhen you get it_.Be _obliging_ and _faithful_ to your employers, and you will be sure tokeep your places. Never be above your business.――Many a man has ruinedhimself and his family by this foolish pride.Ever since the first stone in the foundations of the Universe was laidby God’s own hand till now, he has been working, and will continueworking through endless ages. Follow his glorious example. Work, work,work, for an honest penny; but when you get it, pause and think threetimes before you spend it; but when you spend it, be sure it will yielda permanent benefit.That the hearty welcome which we have given you, our _ransomed_kinsmen, may be rendered a blessing, and that the advices which we havetendered may be as good seed sown in good ground, we shall continue tomake supplications, prayers, intercessions and thanksgivings to Himwhose care reaches all, because His love embraces all.To Him we commend you, O ye who are now as sheep without a shepherd――as_exiles in the land of your nativity_.May He who led Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, as they wandered over Canaanand Egypt, guide, protect and bless you; raise up kind, influentialfriends to do you good; and when the purposes of his grace shall havebeen accomplished in you, may you be able, like Jacob, to say: “With mystaff I passed over this Jordan, and now I am become two bands.”Now, if we ask, who has sent us this great deliverance? The answershall be, the Lord; the Lord God Almighty, the God of Abraham and Isaacand Jacob.But as He blessed the chosen seed, by the ministry of men and angels,so in our case, the angels of mercy, justice and liberty, hovering overthe towering Capitol, inspired the heads and hearts of the noble menwho have plead the cause of the poor, the needy and enslaved, in theSenate and House of Representatives.For the oppressed and enslaved of all peoples, God has raised up, andwill continue to raise up, his Moses and Aaron. Sometimes the handof the Lord is so signally displayed that Moses and Aaron are notrecognized. Seldom do they recognize themselves.There was neither bow, spear, nor shield, in the hand of Israel, whenthe Lord led him forth from Egypt, so also, there was no weapon ofoffence nor defence in your hands when this _ransom_ was brought you.“Great and marvelous are thy works, Lord God Almighty, just and trueare thy ways, thou King of Saints. Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, andglorify thy name? We praise thee, we bless thee, we worship thee, weglorify thee, we give thanks to thee for thy great glory. O Lord God,Heavenly King, God the Father Almighty.”Thou, O Lord, and thou alone couldst have moved the heart of thisNation to have done so great a deed for this weak, despised and needypeople!We will, therefore, make supplications, prayers, intercessions, andthanksgivings, for “All that are in authority.”The duty of supplications in behalf of the Government is rendered morebinding upon us, when we consider the circumstances under which it waswritten. St. Paul lived under the reign of Nero, the bloody emperor,who having set Rome on fire, amused himself with drinking and musicwhile the city was in flames; and afterwards, accused the Christians ofthe crime which he himself had committed, thereby causing many of themto be put to death in the most cruel manner.Now, if it was the duty of the ancient Christians to pray for suchmonsters of wickedness, by how much more is it our duty to pray for aChristian Government.Congress need our supplications, they shall have them. The Presidentand his Cabinet need our prayers, they shall possess them. The SupremeCourt, that awful emblem of impartial justice, need our intercessions,it shall not be forgotten.Upon all these departments of law, authority and power, we shallbeseech the God of Nations to send the spirit of wisdom, justice,liberty――of wisdom seeing the end from the beginning――of justiceincorruptible――of liberty governed by righteous law.To make supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgiving forthese authorities, is the peculiar privilege of the Colored People inthe United States.They are not permitted, as in the days of the Revolution and the war of1812, to take up arms in defence of the Government. Some, both amongAnglo-Saxons and Anglo-Africans, complain of this prohibition. For mypart, I am glad of it, because I think I see the hand of God in it.The present war is a kind of family quarrel. Therefore, let a strangertake heed how he meddles, lest both parties unite to drive him out ofthe house. “Why shouldst thou meddle to thy hurt?”But we can wield a power in behalf of the Government which neitherrifled cannon, nor mortar, nor rocket-battery can assail, norbomb-proof walls resist._That power_ is the right arm of God――of God, who lifts up and castsdown nations according as they obey, or disregard the principles oftruth, justice, liberty.The service of prayer which is required from us, contemplates the mostdifficult as well as the noblest objects. It contemplates the end ofthe war. It contemplates legislation before and after the end.Now, to manage this war, so as to bring permanent good to allconcerned, requires more than human wisdom――more than human power.To legislate so as to make the masses see and feel that the laws arejust, wise, beneficial, demand more than human learning or skill ingovernment. To determine the sense and just application of these lawsas Judges――to execute them faithfully and impartially as a ChiefMagistrate, O how much of the spirit of God is needful! How much in thePresident! how much in his Cabinet!Then there is the army. Let us not forget the brave men who constituteit――who have left their comfortable homes, beloved families, fondparents, affectionate sisters and brothers, for the hardships, dangersand painful deaths of the battle field.Let us pray that, as _some of them are_, so _all may become_, soldiersof the Cross; so that such as are doomed to fall in the fight, may risefrom their gory beds to obtain a crown of life; and those who mayreturn to the peaceful pursuits of civil life, may be wiser and bettermen.Now, then, although weak, few, despised and persecuted, we can aid allthese departments of government by our daily supplications, prayers andintercessions.In doing this service, we can accomplish what we could not if we wereleading the van of battle; for conquering armies are preceded andsucceeded by anguish, misery and death, but our service brings downnothing but blessings upon all.They are also weapons, “not carnal, but mighty through God, to thepulling down of strongholds;” even the casting down of principalitiesand powers――the moving of heaven and earth.Take two examples: When Israel fought against the five kings of theAmorites, Joshua prayed and the sun stood still upon Gibeon, while themoon hung over the valley of Ajalon, till Israel had conquered.“John Knox was a man famous for his power in prayer, so that Queen Maryused to say she feared his prayers more than all the armies of Europe.And events showed she had reason to do it. He used to be in such anagony for the deliverance of his country that he could not sleep. Hehad a place in his garden, where he used to go to pray. One night heand several friends were praying together, and as they prayed Knoxspoke and said that deliverance had come. He could not tell what hadhappened, but he felt that something had taken place, for God had heardtheir prayers. What was it? Why the next news they heard was: ‘QueenMary is dead!’”But the motives for all this work of mercy, faith, and love asfurnished by the text are as weighty as they are numerous.1st. “That we may lead a quiet and peaceable life.” Peace and quietudeare some of the conditions of happiness. Dr. Adam Bluche says: “Ifthe State be not in safety, the individual cannot be secure; selfpreservation, therefore, should lead men to pray for the governmentunder which they live. Rebellions and insurrections seldom terminateeven in political good――and even where the government is radicallybad, revolutions are most precarious and hazardous. They who wishsuch commotions would not be quiet under the most mild and benevolentgovernment.” This is true of communities and nations, as well as ofindividuals. We all desire it, and therefore it is our duty to laborfor it by every instrument which Infinite wisdom has ordained andman can employ. And lo! how excellent the instruments! _Prayers_,_supplications_, _intercessions_――thanksgiving. As Aaron approachedthe Mercy Seat, with the smoking censor, and was accepted, so do weapproach the throne of the Eternal with the burning incense of heaven’sown making, and will be accepted. O, let us supplicate God for thepeace and quietude of the whole nation!2d. The other motive which Inspiration presents is, that we maylive “_in all godliness_ and _honesty_.” Godliness first, honestyafterwards. The latter is the fruit of the former. The godly man, is hewho fears God and keeps his commandments. Such a man will be honest inwords as well as in deeds; in matters of truth as well as in mattersof property. _Honesty is the only policy of godliness._ Colored men,write this sentiment upon your hearts, engrave it in your memory. Letall your thoughts, words, actions, be controlled by this principle, _itis always safe to be honest, as it is always safe to be godly_. One hassaid, that “An honest man is the noblest work of God.” But whence comesthe honest man? Does he not spring out of the godly? Most assuredly.For no man is truly honest, uniformly honest, and universally honest,but he who is godly. Therefore be godly, and you will be honest in allthings, at all times, in all places.3d. The third motive for this heavenly duty, this intercession inbehalf of the Government is, that “It is good and acceptable in thesight of God our Saviour.” Whatever God accepts and pronounces good,_must be good_: good in itself; good in its effects, always good; goodfor man, because ordained of God.4th. The last motive we present for this godlike work is, that God“_Will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of thetruth._”Hence, we must pray for these Authorities not as public men only, butas private individuals also,――not as Chieftains of the Nation only, butas heads of families also,――as husbands, fathers, Christians. So that,while they think, write, speak, act for the public weal, their ownsouls may be brought under the saving power of the Gospel, and with allthe members of their respective families be made the heirs of the graceof life.O, that God may bring them all to the knowledge of the truth asit is in Christ Jesus! O, that every one of these Authorities maybecome a holy, wise, and just man! Then will the laws be enacted inrighteousness and executed in the fear of the Lord.These motives are enforced upon our considerations by the gloriousexample of the Lord Jesus Christ,[A] who is the Mediator between Godand Man, who ever liveth to make intercession for his foes as well ashis friends, and with whom there is no respect of persons. Black men,red men, white men, are all alike before Him, and rise or fall, live ordie as they please or offend Him.[A] When St. Cyprian defended himself before the Roman Pro-Consul, hesaid, “We pray to God not only for ourselves but for all mankind, andparticularly for the Emperors.”Tertullian in his Apology is more particular: “We pray for all theEmperors, that God may grant them long life, a secure government, aprosperous family, vigorous troops, a faithful senate, an obedientpeople; that the whole world may be in peace; and that God may grantboth to Cæsar; and to every man, the accomplishment of their justdesires.”So Origen: “We pray for kings and rulers, that with their royalauthority they may be found possessing a wise and prudent mind.”                                    _See Dr. A. Clarke on the text._To make prayers, intercessions, supplications, thanksgivings fornational authorities you now clearly see _is a command from heaven_.Obey it, and you shall be blessed――always do it, and you shall be madea blessing to others. Whom God has blessed no man can curse. If God hasblessed this nation, neither internal foes, nor foreign enemies cancrush it.But God will bless it if it will do right, administering justiceto each and to all, protecting the weak as well as the strong, andthrowing the broad wings of its power equally over men of every color.This is God-like, and God will bless his own image, be it in a nationor in a man. Then, O my country, “shall thy light break forth as themorning――thy health shall spring forth speedily――thy righteousnessshall go before thee,” and “the glory of the Lord shall be thy reward.”Then shall justice be engraven on our arms, and righteousness on ourstar-spangled banners; our armies shall then be led to battle by theLord, and victory secured by the right arm of our God.                   *       *       *       *       * Transcriber’s Notes: ――Text in italics is enclosed by underscores (_italics_). ――Punctuation, spelling, and printer's errors were silently corrected. ――Archaic and variable spelling has been preserved. ――Variations in hyphenation and compound words have been preserved.*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK WELCOME TO THE RANSOMED, OR,DUTIES OF THE COLORED INHABITANTS OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA ***Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions willbe renamed.Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyrightlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in theUnited States without permission and without paying copyrightroyalties.
